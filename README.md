# A basic node server
### This is a very basic node.js server (created with [express](https://expressjs.com/)), with some basic functions.
### Thank you for many ideas to [Codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/) and [Node Hero](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-hero-tutorial-getting-started-with-node-js/)!
Note that express and body-parser are not in the directory. To run properly, they should be inserted.

Known issues to fix:
- [ ] if you submit an input, that already exists, it will be overwritten
- [ ] the data of the inputs with inappropriate name formats will be not accessible
- [ ] styling
- [ ] .gitignore file is empty
